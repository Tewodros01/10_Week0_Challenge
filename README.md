# Solar Radiation Data Analysis and Visualization Dashboard

This project comprises two tasks: Task One focuses on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), while Task Two involves building an interactive data visualization dashboard. The primary goal is to analyze solar radiation data from multiple locations and visualize it interactively using Streamlit.

## Task One: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

### Overview

Task One provides an exploratory data analysis pipeline for solar radiation datasets. The code handles data cleaning, including addressing missing values, removing duplicates, and providing summary statistics. Additionally, various visualizations are created to understand the data better.

### Data Sources

The datasets used for analysis represent solar radiation data from three locations:

- Benin (Malanville)
- Sierra Leone (Bumbuna)
- Togo (Dapaong)

## Task Two: Interactive Data Visualization Dashboard

## Overview

Task Two creates an interactive data visualization dashboard using Streamlit. The dashboard allows users to select different plot types, columns for analysis, and visualize summary statistics. It integrates various plot functions from Task One with interactive controls.
